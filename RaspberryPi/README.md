# Microsoft IoT Central Reference Firmware for Raspberry Pi 2/3

## Description:

An example of writing a firmware solution to send data to Microsoft IoT Central and to receive events back from Microsoft IoT Central to be processed by the device.  You are free to take this code and the concepts used, and use them as a basis for your own firmware for Microsoft IoT Central.

The aim of this firmware and code is two-fold:

- To provide a good "out of the box" experience for someone wanting to connect a device to Microsoft IoT Central and see real data sent to Microsoft IoT Central.  The firmware was designed to simplify the onboarding experience via a web UX configuration and allow non-developer users to get a device onto Microsoft IoT Central very easily.
- To illustrate how to write a functioning firmware for a Raspberry Pi.  The code pulls together many of the individual samples available in the Azure IoT device SDK into a cohesive story, using relatively simple code.
